# Working 80 MHz hostapd for Raspberry Pi 4B
I have tested it with RaspAP.

I was trying to make this work for months, could not find any hostapd.conf thag would do 80 MHz, it was just crashing it. So I just tried and tried and managed to make it work.

It is 80 MHz, but for some reason it allows only 433 Mbps link speed instead of 866 Mbps. But still better than 200 Mbps on 40 MHz.
